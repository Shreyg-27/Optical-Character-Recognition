# Optical-Character-Recognition

## This is my task as a Computer Vision and IoT intern at the Sparks Foundation. 

### The following steps are followed 

#### 1) Installing and Importing Dependencies
- These include easyOCR ,PyTorch, matplotlib, NumPy
#### 2) Reading the images 
- Reading the result through its image path and printing the length 
#### 3) Draw and Visualise Results
- **Single Line Text** - top left, bottom right coordinates stored, text stores the result. We put a rectangle surrounding the image text, and then add the text on the top left corner.

- **Multi Line Text** - run a for loop to cover all the lines, and follow the same steps as that of single line text.
